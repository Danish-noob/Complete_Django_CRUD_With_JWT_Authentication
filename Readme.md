# Django REST API with JWT and Role-Based Authentication

This project is a Django application featuring a RESTful API secured with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) authentication. It implements role-based access control with two types of users:

- **Admin**: Can create and delete users and products.
- **User**: Can view products.

Currently, the app allows users to browse products, while admins manage users and products. More features will be added in the future.
